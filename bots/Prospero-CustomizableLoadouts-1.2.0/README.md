# Customizable Loadouts Mod

Works with r23 and higher

The purpose of this mod is to provide an opportunity for users and modders 
to customize weapons for all types of bots in the game. 
If you just want to increase the variety of weapons, it is better 
to use AdvancedBotsLoadout (there are no settings there - put and play)

This mod was created on the basis of the Sorata AdvancedBotsLoadout mod, 
also 2 thousand configs from the base game were also added. 
It is quite difficult to create new configs for bots en masse, but we can 
choose the games from the variety of configs. The mod allows you to do 
this using a spreadsheet in Excel and replacing mod.config.json with configs 
you need.

With the default settings of the mod (Prospero-preset), you will 
get the following rules for loadout:

1. Bears use only Russian weapon, Usecs - only NATO weapon. They can have weapon of any quality except trash.
2. Ordinary Scavs carry only Russian weapon poor or average quality.
3. Nobody have bad guns, but Scavs.
4. Marksmans carry medium or good guns, but they are Scavs, therefore, have only Russian guns
5. Pmcbot carry weapons of medium and good quality, but you will not find the most powerful guns, 
for the sake of them you need to kill bosses and their henchmen. 
6. The bosses' assistants turned into real elite fighters, only best weapon.
7. Bosses carry unique weapons, the same as before. I almost did not change them.
